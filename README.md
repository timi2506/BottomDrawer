## Usage
### Examples
**.bottomDrawer { ... }** *View Modifier*
```swift
some View {}
  .bottomDrawer(isPresented: Binding<Bool>?, interactiveDismiss: Bool?, dragHandleVisibility: DragHandleVisibility?, height: Binding<CGFloat>, initialHeight: CGFloat, maxHeight: CGFloat?, content: () -> _)
```
- **isPresented** *Optional*
  - Binding Bool that is used to hide/show the Bottom Drawer, defaults to true
- **interactiveDismiss** *Optional*
  - Bool to define whether the Bottom Drawer should be dismissable by swiping it to be bottom of the Screen, defaults to false
- **dragHandleVisibility** *Optional*
  - Defines the Drag Handles Appearance, more info in the DragHandleVisibility section
- **height** *Required*
  - The Height as a Binding, can be updated and read programatically
- **initialHeight** *Required*
  - The Initial and Minimum Height
- **maxHeight** *Optional*
  - The Maximum Height of the Drawer, defaults to 250
- **content** *Required*
  - The View to show inside of the Drawer
  - *This View is wrapped in a VStack by default*
 
***Optional*** means this value can be safely omitted 

***Required*** means you NEED to define this value and it can't be nil

**Recommended Usecases:**
- ✅ on a Root View
- ✅ on a View that will be navigated to
- ❌ on a View contained inside of another View (for example on a TextView inside of a TabView) *¹

*¹ What to do instead: Apply it on the full TabView
  
  
**DragHandleVisibility** *Enum*
- The Drag Handle Visibility Enum has 3 types:
- **visible** 
    - The Default Appearance, Makes the Handle Visible and with Width Animations adapting to the Drag Height
- **static**
    - same as visible with the exception that the handle's width does not adapt
- **hidden**
    - hides the Drag Handle, this is especially useful for Apps that use their own, custom Drag Handle or programmatic height changing logic
